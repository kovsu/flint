title: CLI

import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

Flint's CLI comes as part of the [`flint` npm package](https://npmjs.com/package/flint).
You can run it with `npx` or an equivalent:

<PackageManagers pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

## `--cache-ignore`

Whether to ignore any existing cache data on disk.
This will cause a full re-lint of all linted files.

<PackageManagers args="--cache-ignore" pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

:::tip
Flint stores linting caches under `node_modules/.cache/flint.json`.
Open that file in an editor to see which files are cached as well as dependencies between files.
:::

## `--fix`

Enables auto-fixing ["fixes"](/glossary#fix) from rule reports.

<PackageManagers args="--fix" pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

Rule reports may include safe "fixer" changes that show how to fix source code.
Adding `--fix` will instruct Flint to continuously re-run (up to 10 times), fixing code and re-linting files.

## `--fix-suggestions`

Enables auto-fixing any number of specific ["suggestions"](/glossary#suggestion) from rule reports.

<PackageManagers
	args="--fix-suggestions cspell:addWordToWords"
	pkg="flint"
	type="dlx"
/>

Unlike [`--fix`](#--fix), `--fix-suggestions` requires passing in explicit names of suggestions to apply.
Suggestion names are comprised of the rule name, and a suggestion ID, all joined by `:`.

:::note
[🚀 Feature: Comment directives and suggestions should prefix with plugin IDs](https://github.com/flint-fyi/flint/issues/248) will soon change suggestion keys.
:::

## `--help`

Prints a help text dialog that explains options and links to this website.

<PackageManagers args="--help" pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

## `--interactive`

Whether to run Flint with an interactive "one file at a time" viewer.

<PackageManagers args="--interactive" pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

Flint's interactive CLI view can be controlled by using the arrow keys printed in the output:

```plaintext

│
│  6:1 │ for (const i in ["a", "b", "c"]) {
│      │ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
│
│  A for-in loop (`for (const i in o)`) iterates over all enumerable properties of an object, including those that are not array indices.
│  This can lead to unexpected behavior when used with arrays, as it may include properties that are not part of the array's numeric indices.
│  It also returns the index key (`i`) as a string, which is not the expected numeric type for array indices.
│
│  Suggestion: Use a construct more suited for arrays, such as a for-of loop (`for (const i of o)`).

```

:::tip
The `--interactive` mode switches the default [`--presenter`](#--presenter) from `brief` to `detailed`.
It does not, however, enable `--watch` by default.
Run with `--interactive --watch` to use both modes.
:::

## `--presenter`

Which ["presenter"](/glossary#presenter) to output results using: `brief` _(default)_ or `detailed`.

<PackageManagers args="--presenter detailed" pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

The `brief` presenter shows a terse output with just file locations, primary report messages, and report IDs.

```plaintext
Linting with flint.config.ts...

  6:1  For-in loops over arrays have surprising behavior that often leads to bugs.  forInArrays

✖ Found 1 report across 1 file.
```

The `detailed` presenter shows a rich formatted output containing full report messages and syntax locations.

## `--skip-diagnostics`

Whether to skip reporting language "diagnostics" after linting.

<PackageManagers args="--skip-diagnostics" pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

Language plugins such as Flint's TypeScript plugin are able to report additional checks from the languages after linting.
For example, Flint's core TypeScript plugin reports TypeScript type errors (effectively running `tsc --noEmit`) by re-using the TypeScript type services used in linting.

`--skip-diagnostics` can be used to disable those checks.
You may wish to do this for performance and/or if you run tools like `tsc` separately from Flint.

## `--version`

Prints the current package version of Flint.

<PackageManagers args="--version" pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

## `--watch`

Whether to keep the linting process running, re-linting files as they change.

<PackageManagers args="--watch" pkg="flint" type="dlx" />

Flint's `--watch` mode is similar to the watch mode in other developer tools CLIs such as [`tsc --watch`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html#:~:text=Watch%20Options,-Flag), [`tsdown --watch`](https://tsdown.dev/options/watch-mode), and [`vitest --watch`](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html#watch).
It will lint files once on startup, then again whenever any linted files are changed on disk.
