description: "Configuring Flint from a config file."
title: Configuration
---

Linting with Flint must be configured by at least one `flint.config.*` configuration file, in the root of a repository to be linted.
That file may be any extension recognized by your version of Node.js.

Flint configs must default-export the result of calling the [`defineConfig`](#defineconfig) function imported from the `flint` package.
`flint` also exports a [`globs`](#globs) object for common file globs, as well as objects for each of the [core plugins](/rules#core-plugins).

## `defineConfig`

Defines a new configuration for linting.
It takes in an object with one required property, [`use`](#use):

```ts twoslash title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: ts.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```

### `ignore`

A list of glob patterns to ignore from linting.
This can be a `string`, any level deep array of `string`s, or an object containing [`exclude` and `include`](#exclude-and-include).

`ignore` by default includes all patterns defined in a `.gitignore` file, if it exists.

This `ignore` directive ignores all files under `src/legacy/`:

```ts twoslash title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	ignore: ["src/legacy/**/*"],
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: ts.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```

### `use`

The only required object property to pass to `defineConfig` is `use`, an array of definitions containing two properties:

- `files`: glob pattern(s) describing which file(s) to lint
- `rules`: any number of rules to enable for those files

#### `files`

Any number of glob pattern(s) describing file(s) to lint.
This can be a `string`, any level deep array of `string`s, or an object containing [`exclude` and `include`](#exclude-and-include).

For example, this `files` selector matches all TypeScript test files by extension and in a directory:

```ts twoslash title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ["src/**/*.test.*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"],
			rules: ts.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```

See the [Node.js file system `glob` documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fspromisesglobpattern-options) for details on glob patterns.

##### `exclude` and `include`

In addition to plain `string`s, `files` selectors can also be objects with two properties:

- `exclude`: glob pattern(s) to _not_ include in the files group
- `include`: glob pattern(s) to include in the files group

For example, this `files` selector matches all TypeScript source files that don't have a `*.test.*` extension:

```ts twoslash title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: {
				exclude: "**/*.test.*",
				include: ts.files.all,
			},
			rules: ts.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```

#### `rules`

Any number of rule(s) to enable on the corresponding [`files`](#files).
These may be arrays of rules, such as from presets exported by plugins, and/or calls to plugin rules themselves.

For example, this `rules` entry enables all the recommended logical and stylistic TypeScript rules:

```ts twoslash title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: [ts.presets.logical, ts.presets.stylistic],
		},
	],
});
```

##### Configuring Rules

Rules can be configured or disabled by calling to the `rules` method of their plugin.
That method takes in an object where the keys are rule names and values are what to do with the rule:

- `true`: enable it (if it wasn't already)
- `false`: disable it (if it was previously enabled)
- Object containing options: enable it with those options

For example, this `rules` entry disables one rule and reconfigures another:

```ts twoslash title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: [
				ts.presets.logical,
				ts.presets.stylistic,
				ts.rules({
					debuggerStatements: false,
					namespaceDeclarations: {
						allowDeclarations: true,
					},
				}),
			],
		},
	],
});
```

## `globs`

A helper object containing file selectors with dynamic computed values.
Currently it contains only one selector, [`all`](#all).

### `all`

Includes all files previously selected by the configuration.

For example, this config enables the [spelling plugin](/rules/spelling) on all files that are being linted, which includes multiple languages:

```ts twoslash title="flint.config.ts"
import { spelling } from "@flint.fyi/spelling";
import { defineConfig, globs, md, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: md.files.all,
			rules: md.presets.logical,
		},
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: [ts.presets.logical, ts.presets.stylistic],
		},
		{
			files: globs.all,
			rules: spelling.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```

## Inline Directives

You can also disable specific rules inline in your code using [comment directives](/directives).
This is useful when you need to suppress a rule for a specific line, block, or file.

### Workspaces

:::danger
Flint configuration workspaces are not yet implemented.
See [flint-fyi/flint#64 🚀 Feature: Config file workspaces support](https://github.com/flint-fyi/flint/issues/64) for details.
