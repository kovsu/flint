## Presets

Flint's TypeScript plugin provides the following presets:

| Preset                                    | Recommended   | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[`logical`](#logical)**                 | ✅ Always     | Common rules for finding bugs and enforcing good logical practices.     |
| **[`logicalStrict`](#logicalstrict)**     | ☑️ When Ready | Additional rules for finding bugs and enforcing good logical practices. |
| **[`stylistic`](#stylistic)**             | ✅ Always     | Common rules for consistent styling and best stylistic practices.       |
| **[`stylisticStrict`](#stylisticstrict)** | ☑️ When Ready | Additional rules for consistent styling and best stylistic practices.   |
| **[`javascript`](#javascript)**           |               | Extra rules for files that aren't type-checked by TypeScript.           |

If you are just getting started with linting, Flint recommends using the [`logical`](#logical) and [`stylistic`](#stylistic) presets:

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: [ts.presets.logical, ts.presets.stylistic],
		},
	],
});
```

If you are experienced with both JavaScript/TypeScript and linting, Flint recommends using the [`logicalStrict`](#logicalstrict) and [`stylisticStrict`](#stylisticstrict) presets:

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: [ts.presets.logicalStrict, ts.presets.stylisticStrict],
		},
	],
});
```

### `logical`

Rules that find bugs and enforce good logical practices for most-to-all JavaScript and TypeScript files.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: ts.presets.logical,
		},
	],
});
```

### `logicalStrict`

Additional logical rules that enforce best practices which are not always straightforward to implement.
These rules are recommended for projects where a majority of developers are experienced with both JavaScript/TypeScript and using a linter.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: ts.presets.logicalStrict,
		},
	],
});
```

This preset's rules are a superset of those in [`logical`](#logical).

### `stylistic`

Rules that enforce consistent styling and best stylistic practices for most-to-all JavaScript and TypeScript files.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: ts.presets.stylistic,
		},
	],
});
```

### `stylisticStrict`

Additional stylistic rules that enforce best practices which are not always straightforward to implement.
These rules are recommended for projects where a majority of developers are experienced with both JavaScript/TypeScript and using a linter.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.all,
			rules: ts.presets.stylisticStrict,
		},
	],
});
```

This preset's rules are a superset of those in [`stylistic`](#stylistic).

### `javascript`

Rules that fill in rudimentary safety practices that would normally be caught by TypeScript.

```ts title="flint.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, ts } from "flint";

export default defineConfig({
	use: [
		{
			files: ts.files.javascript,
			rules: ts.presets.javascript,
		},
	],
});
```

The `javascript` preset is broadly applicable for JavaScript files that aren't type-checked by TypeScript.
For long-lived projects, Flint recommends using this only as a stopgap measure pending converting files fully to TypeScript.

## Rules

## Selectors

Flint's TypeScript plugin provides the following file selectors:

- `all`: `**/*.{cjs,cts,js,jsx,mjs,mts,ts,tsx}`
- `javascript`: `**/*.{cjs,js,jsx,mjs}`
- `typescript`: `**/*.{cts,mts,ts,tsx}`
