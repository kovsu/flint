<RuleSummary plugin="ts" rule="evals" />

The `eval()` function evaluates a string as JavaScript code.
This is dangerous because it can execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.

Using `eval()` has several problems:

- Security risks: executing untrusted code can lead to code injection attacks
- Performance issues: `eval()` prevents JavaScript engine optimizations
- Debugging difficulty: dynamically executed code is harder to debug and trace
- CSP violations: many Content Security Policies prohibit `eval()`

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
const code = getUserInput();
eval(code);
```

```ts
const result = eval("2 + 2");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```ts
const data = '{"name": "John"}';
const obj = JSON.parse(data);
```

```ts
const calculate = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
const result = calculate(2, 2);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

This rule is not configurable.

## When Not To Use It

In rare cases, `eval()` may be necessary for dynamic code execution, such as in development tools or REPLs.
If you have a legitimate use case and understand the security implications, you may disable this rule for specific lines.
Consider using the `Function` constructor as a slightly safer alternative, though it still carries risks.
